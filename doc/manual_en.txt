1 What is SSDE?

  SSDE is a small, scalable disassembly engine, purposed to analyze machine
  code and retrieving information on instructions (their length, opcode,
  correctness, etc).

  SSDE is quite functional, e.g.: you can build a complete disassembler
  which would output assembly listing of the program, generated from machine
  code using SSDE. Scalability of SSDE lets you perform analysis of several
  branches at the same time using multithreading.

2. "Why does SSDE exist, if disassembler engines such as HDE, diStorm,
  BeaEngine etc already exist?" or "The advantages of SSDE"

  Motivation for writing SSDE was that existing disassembler engines were
  either large and/or were non-free, or they were obsolete and wouldn't
  support new instructions and nobody maintained those. Other than that,
  it's planned to support different architectures (these are most likely
  to be added shortly: x86 64, ARM32). SSDE is licensed under MIT license,
  which lets you use it in your private or commerical projects without
  any kinds of restrictions or liabilities. SSDE modules are written with
  portability in mind: they should work on any machines, regardless of
  architecture, endianness or OS etc. All SSDE code is written in C++,
  compliant to C++11. All public API is well documented (see "ssde.hpp")
  and the implementation is quite clean and maintainable.

  Main advantages of SSDE over other engines are:

    - modularity (use only what is required)
    - high performance when analyzing long sequences of machine code
    - small size
    - independent of processor architecture, byte order and OS
    - free to use


  ssde_x86 module provides support for new and not really extensions
        AES, SHA, VMX
        MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, FMA3
        other minor extensions (CPUID, ADX, RDSEED, RDRAND etc)

2.1 Performance and benchmarks

  There were no proper benchmarks performed yet, though I have done a
  micro benchmark of ssde_x86 to compare performance against HDE and
  figuring out cases which slow down instruction decoding.

  cl 19.00.22816 (Visual C++ 2015) /O2
  win8.1 x64
  core i3 2350m @ 2.3 GHz

  Analysis of sequence of 17 instructions, 1M iterations

    SSDE : 4.942 s, 0.000029 s/instruction
    HDE  : 5.542 s, 0.000032 s/instruction

  There are 2 cases known where SSDE will lose to HDE in performance.

    - frequent reinitialization of disassembler object
    - analysis of instructions which require displacements, immediates,
        relative addresses etc to be read.

  Further benchmarks will be done on various architectures (other than x86,
  ARM LE and MIPS BE will probably be used) under GNU/Linux.

3 How to use SSDE?

  SSDE was written in C++, compliant to C++11. To include SSDE into your
  project you're required to have compiler that supports C++11.

  Each module has at least two constructors. Primary constructor and copy
  constructor. Primary constructor takes

    1: std::string container with binary data.

  Copy constructor can be used to make analysis parallel, e.g.: branch
  analysis.

3.1 Various architectures

  Modular structure gives you ability to include only modules you need in
  your project. Key file is "ssde.hpp". "*.cpp" and other "*.hpp" files are
  optional and can be omitted. e.g.: if you wish you use SSDE only for X86,
  then the files you will have to include are "ssde.hpp", "ssde_x86.hpp" and
  "ssde_x86.cpp".

3.2 Decoding errors

  When decoding instructions, errors can appear. They usually appear
  because of malformed instructions in machine code. In many cases critical
  errors do NOT happen and instruction decoding goes right. Though, there
  are two exceptional errors, which deny any guarantees that instruction
  will be decoded properly. Those are: error_opcode and error_length.
  error_opcode appears when the decoder meets opcode it isn't aware of.
  error_length appears when instruction is unnaturally too long.

  During analysis, if any error appears, field  "error" will be set to
  "true", so will be the field indicating the kind of the error.


  Fields that signal about errors are:

    - error         : "true" if any error appears at all
    - error_opcode  : "true" in case of an unknown opcode
    - error_operand : "true" if one of instruction operands isn't valid
    - error_length  : "true" if instruction is too long (15 max in X86)

  WARNING!

    In case of IP overflow (IP goes out of buffer's bounds) field
    "ip_overflow" will be set to "true". While "ip_overflow" == true,
    ::dec() won't do anything. You have to manually reset the field
    before you do any analysis.

3.3 Multithreading

  SSDE is not thread safe.

  Though, multithread analysis for branched code is still possible using
  threads and new disassembler object dedicated to the branch.

4 Adding support for new architecture

  To add support for a new architecture, you have to create a class
  which is final, it should be called "ssde_ARCHITECTURE", inherit from
  "ssde" and use ssde::ssde constructors. Prototypes of all classes must
  be declared in ssde.hpp. e.g.:

    /* ssde.hpp */
      class ssde_arm final : public ssde
      {
      public:
        using ssde::ssde;

        void dec() override final; // Decode the instruction pointed by IP.

      private:
        void reset_fields();

      public:
        bool error_shift = false; // Bit shift used wrong.
      }

  If you plan to contribute, your code style shall be the same as style
  of project's code.

5 Reporting an error

  If you find some error, before you write the report you are advised to
  make sure you're using the latest version of SSDE and that the error is
  in SSDE algorithm and not your code. You can send the report at http://github.com/notnanocat/ssde/issues
  Other than the report, it's recommended that you supply code which will
  reproduce the error in SSDE. The report should describe the conditions
  the error happens in, name of module and the method it appears in.

**The Small Scalable Disassembler Engine**


If, while using the SSDE, you find an error, before you write a report
you are advised to make sure you're using the latest stable version of
SSDE. You are also advised to make sure it's not your code that is buggy.


At http://github.com/notnanocat/ssde/issues create an issue explaining
the bug.

It's recommended that you provide as much information on the bug as
possible, that vastly increases your changes of getting your bug fixed.
In your bug report tell us which disassembler module you think has the
bug, under which conditions it happens, etc. We'd really appreciate if
you provide us an example code which can be used to reproduce the bug.
If you have fixed the bug by yourself, you can do a pull request.
Though, you are still required to provide explaination on the bug like
it's described above.
